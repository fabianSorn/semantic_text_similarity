# TODOs
## Technical
- **[DONE]** Create simple Docker Container for the Script so it can be used under Windows
- **[DONE]** Download use-model and load it locally (had some caching errors)
- **[OPEN]** Profile how long loading the model is taking. Maybe a solution for
             keeping it in memory?
## Research
- **[IN PROGRESS]** Test results with sentence fraction without the obvious parts
